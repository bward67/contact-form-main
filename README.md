I would be very grateful for any help with my code on this one. The radio query bit is not working. I get the error text to come up but I can't get it to remove once I have selected a button.

When I do this: - I get null
const queryType = document.querySelector(
'form .query-container .query-inputs input[name="query"]:checked'
);
console.log(queryType); //this gives me null

Also I can't get the message box to appear once the form is completed correctly yet I know it works because if I put: if(!isValid) it does come up.

I am going to continue to try to fix whatever I have done wrong but I thought it would be no harm to ask for help in the meantime even though it makes me feel a bit like a loser :(

Thanks in advance :)
