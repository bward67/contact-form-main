This was a good challenge as I had not created a full form in a while. I used text-area for the message input. It was good to learn that you don't just have to set cols and rows with text-area but that you can also set the style="width: 100%".

Accent-color was a new one for me in css to change the background-color of the checkbox and radio inputs.
